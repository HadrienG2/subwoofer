# System setup

In this section, we discuss the steps needed to prepare your computer for a
Subwoofer run. Some of these steps are [required](requirements.md) for the
benchmark to build and run at all, while others are mere
[suggestions](suggestions.md) to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the
data acquisition process.

Unless specified otherwise, you only need to perform these setup steps once per
computer. They do not need to be repeated if you later need to re-run Subwoofer
on the same machine, either to test out new Subwoofer developments or to explore
new aspects of subnormal arithmetic that you skipped on a previous run.
